The project I worked on after completing the JavaScript course is a book search system. This project was created to apply all the skills and knowledge I gained during the course.

The main goal of this project was to develop functionality for searching books based on various criteria, such as title, author, genre, etc. I used JavaScript for data processing and user interaction, HTML and CSS for creating the user interface.

The main components of the project included a search form, input for search criteria, displaying search results, and the ability to interact with the found books.

This project not only allowed me to reinforce my knowledge of JavaScript but also provided an opportunity to practically apply them in a real project. It also helped me better understand the principles of working with data, variables, and functions, as well as improve my HTML and CSS skills for creating a convenient and attractive user interface.
